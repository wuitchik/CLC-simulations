# CLC Simulations

This repository contains simulation models, analysis scripts, and manuscript materials for a study on evolutionary lag in species with complex life cycles (CLCs). Code is currently being developed, so expect changes and egregious errors. 

## Repository Structure

- `data/raw/`: Raw output files from SLiM simulations (unmodified).
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned or summarized data used for analysis or figures.
- `figs/`: Final figures generated for the manuscript.
- `scripts/slim/`: SLiM simulation scripts.
- `scripts/analysis/`: Post-processing and analysis scripts (R or Python).
- `scripts/slurm/`: cluster scheduling and job management
- `tex/`: LaTeX manuscript and related files.
  - `main.tex`: Main LaTeX file for the manuscript.
